# Applied Cryptography DD2520

## Course contents

Basic concepts and principles of cryptography, intuition about security, implementation and engineering aspects as well as influence on society, black box analysis, use of cryptographic primitives such as symmetric and asymmetric encryption in applications, digital signatures, cryptographic hash functions, and simple cryptosystems and cryptographic protocols.

## Intended learning outcomes

After passing the course, the student should be able to:

- use basic terminology in computer security and cryptography correctly
- describe cryptographic concepts and explain their security properties
- find and use documentation of cryptographic libraries and standards
- identify and categorize threats against a cryptographic IT system at a conceptual level, suggest appropriate countermeasures, and present the reasoning to others

in order to:

- as a citizen and engineer be able to discuss applied cryptography in general and the risks of using/developing cryptography in particular
- in professional life and/or research and development projects be able to evaluate challenges in software development related to cryptography.
